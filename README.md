# ssbm website

- a website replicating the look of Super Smash Bros Melee's menus
- theoretically, the website will look like these screenshots:
  <img src="./ssbmWebsite/tree/master/item/assets/screenshots/titleScreen.png"></img>
  <img src="./ssbmWebsite/tree/master/item/assets/screenshots/mainMenu.png"></img>
  <img src="./ssbmWebsite/tree/master/item/assets/screenshots/specialMeleeMenu.png"></img>

## [assets/](./assets/)

- this directory contains a raw dump of (most of) the textures I will use for the website. the assets are unsorted and often in multiple pieces currently

## todo

- combine button assets to make template button
  - don't forget about the breathing glow effect around the buttons
- use css hand as cursor
- migrate to `todo.sr.ht/~andybabcock/site` for todo tracking
