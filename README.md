# site

- I am trying to make a website themed after super smash bros melee, and experiment with sourcehut's website hosting.

## assets/

- this directory contains a raw dump of (most of) the textures I will use for the website. the assets are unsorted and often in multiple pieces currently

## todo

- combine button assets to make template button
  - don't forget about the breathing glow effect around the buttons
- use css hand as cursor
- migrate to `todo.sr.ht/~andybabcock/site` for todo tracking
